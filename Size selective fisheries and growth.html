  Size selective fisheries and growth

Assume fish in a cohort grow according to the von Bertalanffy growth
curve, where KK and L∞L∞ for each individual are drawn from a random
normal distribution with a mean and variance. The growth of individuals
and the mean size will look like this over the age of the cohort.

If the fish are subject to random mortality, then eliminating individual
fish will not change the average size at age (dark line).

However, adding a fishery with a minimize size limit will preferentially
remove the fish that happen to grow faster or larger, reducing the
average size for fish at older ages.

If you take a sample and fit the von Bertalanffy growth curve, with
random mortality, the estimated parameters are close to correct. This is
one random draw.

But with a size limit, the estimates are biased by the fact that few
large fish survive to be old. This is one random draw.

If you fit multiple random samples with no size limit and plot the
distribution of estimated values, you can see that they are correct on
average. In this plot, colors are random draws. The black line is correct.

With the size limit, the bias is clear.
